    "After some discussion, we have decided that we wish to ultimately build a model for the Covid-19 epidemic, by first leveraging the knowledge we can gain from a better understood, and better documented disease activity: influenza in the US. For the latter, we are given a dataset of the infection rate of the flu in the entire US, from 2010 until 2020. We believe that this contains valuable information on the spread of disease activity in general, which could serve as basis to build forecasting models for Covid-19. "
