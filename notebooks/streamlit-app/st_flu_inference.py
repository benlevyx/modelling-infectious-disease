Collecting these state-level characteristics can help us identify which features are responsible for the correlation in viral infection rates between states, and thus can also be used to quantify the correlation between states based on fundamental attributes of the states rather than just the raw wILI time series.")

	st.write("The density of a state is a natural feature to include because the denser a location, the more easily a virus can spread (look no further than NYC right now). However, it wouldn't make sense to report the density of a state because, for example, the high population density in Manhattan shouldn't be influenced by the fact that upstate New York State has a massive amount of scarsely populated land. Instead, a more sensible measure is a weighted average of the densities of each county in a given state, where the weights are the fraction of the state population that lives in the given county.")

	st.write("### Motivation")

	st.write("Before describing the model, it's important to first discuss the motivation behind it in the first place. The wILI time series clearly show that the states are affected differently by the flu. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether there are any state-level features that account for the disrepencies between the states. If we could identify these particular features, then we'd also be able to figure out which states are intrinsically linked based on their attributes.") 
	st.write("This information would then allow us to transfer this knowledge about the flu to Covid-19. Because both the flu and Covid are viruses, we'd expect some of the underlying risk factors of flu to generalize to Covid as well. We could then take one of two routes: first, we could assess if the interstate correlations discovered from the flu data apply in the case of Covid by comparing the number of Covid cases among different states. And second, we could assume that the flu relationships apply in the case of Covid and use these insights to look deeper than just the raw Covid numbers. For example, if the flu analysis reveals that two states share many similar characteristics, and one of these states has more Covid cases per 1000 people but also has more testing, then we may believe that the second state has more case of Covid than are reported. Alternatively, we can identify states that, based on their characteristics (e.g. high density, high obesity rate), are more susceptible to a major spike in Covid cases and thus should take additional precautions when opening up their states.")

	st.write("### Model Formulation")

	st.write("If the state wILI rates are correlated with each other, then we should, in theory, be able to predict the wILI rate in a given state and for a given week from the wILI rates of all the other states for the same week. Because correlated states may have similar flu trajectories but have different raw wILI rates, it's more robust to predict the weekly percent change in wILI rather than the absolute change in wILI. This means that we want to predict the trend in the number of flu cases for each state based on the trends of all the other states at the same time.")

	st.write("The big question is obviously how to use the percent change in the wILI rate of every other state to predict the percent change in the wILI rate for a single state. Because some states are more closely correlated with a given state than others, it makes sense to predict the percent change for a given state to be a weighted average of the percent changes of the other weeks, where the weights should ideally be proportional to the underlying correlation between the two states. For example, if we were trying to predict the trend in New York, we'd take into account the trend of every other state (except for Alaska and Hawaii), but the influence of each of these states on our overall prediction for New York would vary (e.g. the influence of New Jersey and Connecticut may be high, while the influenced of Idaho and Nebraska may be low).")

	st.write("Converting this into formal notation, let's define $\\delta_i$ to be the percent change in the wILI rate between two consecutive weeks for state $i$, and define $\\alpha_{ij}$ to be the weight coefficient of state $j$ on state $i$. We predict each $\\delta_i$ as:")

	st.latex("\\delta_i \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{48}\\alpha_{ij}\\delta_jI(j \\neq i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{48}\\alpha_{ij}I(j \\neq i)}, {\\sigma_{i}}^2\\right)")

	st.write("where ${\\sigma_{i}}^2$ is a state-specific variance. Intuitively, the lower the value of ${\\sigma}^2$ for a given state, the more the variation in the state's wILI trend can be explained by the wILI trends of the other states, and vice versa.")

	st.write("Next, we want to link the $\\alpha_{ij}$ weights to the features associated with each state such that states with more similar characteristics and high rates of interstate travel have higher $\\alpha_{ij}$ and $\\alpha_{ji}$ values and vice versa. Additionally, we only want a few of the $\\alpha_{ij}$s corresponding to state $i$ to be large, and the rest to be small (in a similar spirit to regularization). We can accomplish both of these features as follows: first, each $\\alpha_{ij}$ is modelled as being distributed according to an exponential distribution with a scale (i.e. inverse rate) parameter of $\\lambda_{ij}$. Because an exponential distribution is right skewed and has most of its mass near zero, this ensures that most of the $\\alpha_{ij}$ that are drawn from exponential distributions will take on relatively small values, while only a few will take on relatively large values. Next, we link the scale parameter ($\\lambda_{ij}$) of this exponential distribution to the state-level features by setting the log of $\\lambda_{ij}$ equal to the linear predictor function (taking the log is necessary to map the domain of the scale parameter (all positive real numbers) to the domain of the linear prediction function (the entire real line)).")

	st.write("Translating this into formal notation:")

	st.latex("\\alpha_{ij} \\sim Expo(\\lambda_{ij})")

	st.latex("log(\\lambda_{ij}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... + \\beta_kX_k")

	st.write("In this case the linear predictor function is a little different that usual. Two of the predictors (normalized number of commuters between states $i$ and $j$ and the indicator of whether state $j$ borders state $i$) are included in the usual form of $\\beta_iX_i$, where a unit increase in $X_i$ corresponds to a $\\beta_i$ increase in the linear predictor. However, the rest of the predictors are state-level features such as obesity rate and density. This means that we don't care about the raw values of these features; instead, we only care about the difference between the values for state $i$ and state $j$. Therefore, each of the predictors is defined to be $|X_i - X_j|$, such that the predictor value is 0 when the two states have the same feature value, and increases as the difference between the two states grows.")

	st.write("Finally, because this is a Bayesian model, we need to define a prior distribution for the model parameters, which in this case are the $\\beta$ coefficient associated with each predictor variable and the ${\\sigma}^2$ parameter associated with each state. Because we have no substantial prior domain knowledge, we placed relatively uninformative priors on these parameters. Putting all of these components together produces the following generative model:")

	st.latex("\\delta_i \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{48}\\alpha_{ij}\\delta_jI(j \\neq i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{48}\\alpha_{ij}I(j \\neq i)}, {\\sigma_{i}}^2\\right)")

	st.latex("\\sigma_{i}^{2} \\sim Inv-Gamma(2, 2)")

	st.latex("\\alpha_{ij} \\sim Expo(\\lambda_{ij})")

	st.latex("log(\\lambda_{ij}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... + \\beta_kX_k")

	st.latex("\\beta_i \\sim N(0, 5^2) ")

	st.write("Performing inference for this model yields the posterior distribution of the $\\beta$s and the ${\\sigma}^2$, but we only really care about the $\\beta$s. Because the exponential distribution is parameterized by a scale parameter rather than the usual rate parameter, the expected value of the distribution is equal to the scale parameter. This means that a larger $\\lambda_{ij}$ value corresponds, on average, to a higher $\\alpha_{ij}$ coefficient, and because the linear predictor function is defined to be the log of $\\lambda_{ij}$, this in turn means that a larger linear predictor corresponds, on average, to a higher $\\alpha_{ij}$ coefficient. For the two predictors that are not differences between the two given states, this means that a positive $\\beta$ coefficent indicates that a unit increase in the predictor value produces a stronger correlation between the two given states and vice versa. On the other hand, for the rest of the predictors that are included as differences between certain features of the two states, a strong correlation between two given states is signified by a negative $\\beta$ coefficient. This is the case because the predictor value represents the absolute differences between the features of the states, so a larger predictor value corresponds to a larger discrepancy between the states. Thus, the corresponding $\\beta$ coefficient can be interpreted as a penalty parameter, such that states that are less similar in terms of the given feature are less correlated with each other (assuming the $\\beta$ coefficient value is negative).")

	st.write("Overall, the model provides us with two interpretative results. First, the $\\beta$ coefficients indicate which features contribute to the correlation between the wILI time series of different states. And second, the $\\beta$ coefficients tell us about the $\\alpha_{ij}$ weights, which, in turn, inform us about which states are highly correlated with each other based on the fundamental characteristics of the states.")

	st.write("Finally, one major advantage of this model is that the observations (i.e. the percent change in the wILI rate for a given week) are independent of each other conditioned on the percent changes of the other states for the same week. This means that unlike in a classic time seris model, the past wILI rates of a state are irrelevant to predicting the percent change in the wILI rate at any given time. This greatly simplifies things, as it's much easier to deal with independent observations than it is to handle observations that are correlated with previous observations.")

Therefore, performance inference for the actual data should yield reliable results.\n\nHowever, carrying out inference on this synthetic data reveals several issues. First, many of the r_hat values are significantly larger than 1.0, which means that more than 500 samples are needed for the chains to converge to the posterior distribution. And second, the fact that the sampling took so long may indicate that the uninformative priors are too flat and make it difficult for the NUTS sampler to sample points from the true posterior distribution. To address these issues, the number of samples is increased from 500 to 1000 and a semi-informative prior is placed on the $\\beta$ and $\\sigma^2$ parameters ($N(0, 25)$ for each of the $\\beta$s and $Inv-Gamma(2, 2)$ for each $\\sigma^2$.")

We then tried running in a second time, and this time it again was 80 percent done after another 14 hours and then encountered a memory failure issue that terminated the notebook. Therefore, the third time we only asked for 500 samples, even though we knew this likely wouldn't be large enough for the sampler to converge. It took 14 hours to run but finished successfully. Even so, the model was so unwieldy that it took an additional three hours just to save the model and create a summary dataframe.")

However, if we had more time, we'd randomly select a subset of the observations and get more samples for these observations, as it's better to have trustworthy results on less data than it is to have unreliable results on the entire datset.")

	st.write("While the results of the inference were unreliable, it's still worthwhile to discuss what the next steps would have been in the analysis. First, we would check the sign and 94 percent credible interval of each of the $\\beta$ coefficients to see if the majority of them make intuitive sense (i.e. negative coefficients for the difference predictors and positive coefficients for the non-difference predictors.) Next, we would evaluate the predictive power of the model and test the model assumptions at the same time. This could be done by first calculating the predictive power of a baseline naive model where the average of all the other states is used to predict for the percent change in the final state (in other words, where the weights associated with each state are the same). Because the likelihood function is modelled as a normal distribution, the optimal loss function is the mean squared error. The predictions would be performed for each state separately. \n\nAfter calculating the MSE for the naive model, we'd evaluate the Bayesian model as follows: first, we'd sample hundreds of times from the posterior distribution of each of the $\\beta$ coefficients. Then, for each sample, we'd work our way up the model (i.e. sample an $\\alpha$ for each state) and calculate the mean of the prediction. We'd then plot the residuals by subtracting the predicted percent change from the true percent change. Calculating the average of the square of the residuals would give us the MSE, which we'd compare to the baseline model to see if this model has any increased predictive power. Meanwhile, we'd plot these residuals to assess the assumption that the observations are normally distributed about the weighted average of the percent change of each of the other states. If this is the case, then we'd expect the distribution to being normally distributed around 0.0. Finally, we can calculate the variance of the residuals for each state and compare this sample variance to the posterior distribution of $\\sigma^2$ for each state to check if they are consistent with each other.")
