    ## Goals and problem statement
    
    The overarching goal of this project is to build models to predict seasonal
    influenza and COVID-19, hopefully using information about the former to augment
    our predictions and inferences about the latter. The project consists of the
    following components:
    
    **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**
    
    We examine the time series data for seasonal flu, noting interesting spatial
    and temporal patterns.
    
    **2. Data preprocessing**
    
    We transfer the data to a usable form, filling in unwanted gaps in the
    flu time series using a gaussian process.
    
    **3. Flu inference**
    
    We build a Bayesian model that aims to estimate the spatial dependencies
    between states and explain those dependencies in terms of underlying features
    of those states.
    
    **4. Flu forecasting**
    
    We use sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) recurrent neural networks to forecast
    the seasonal flu,
    
    **5. COVID-19 forecasting**
    
    We construct a spatial Bayesian model for COVID-19, using geographic
    patterns to inform the spatial dependencies.
    
    **6. COVID-19 transfer learning**
    
    We pre-train seq2seq models on the seasonal flu and examine whether this
    pre-training can be used to improve COVID-19 forecasting using transfer
    learning (TL).
